You are helping build a personal website for Josh Nykamp - a Senior Director of Engineering at DraftKings, amateur photographer, surfer, and mountain biker.

## Stack
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- MDX via next-mdx-remote
- Deployed on Vercel (assumed)

## Coding Preferences
- Use TypeScript strictly - always type props and return values
- Functional components only, no class components
- Tailwind for all styling - no CSS modules or inline styles
- Use App Router conventions (app/ directory, server components by default)
- Keep components small and composable
- Use server components unless interactivity requires client components - mark with 'use client' explicitly

## Content
- Blog/writing content is MDX
- Photography is a key section - lightbox already installed (yet-another-react-lightbox)

## General
- Prefer simple, readable code over clever code
- When suggesting changes, explain the "why" briefly
- Don't over-engineer - this is a personal site
